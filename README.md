# READTHIS

## Description
I wanted to provide myself and all users across the internet an easy way to make a proper README!

### Motivation
It's essential for every project to have to briefly display it's functionality and instructions.

### Problem Solved
It makes sure you don't have a bad README! Saves the user a lot of a time and stress in creating a README everytime.

### What I Learned
How a README should look like, JQUERY values, and dynamic generation.
