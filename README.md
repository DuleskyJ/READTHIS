# READTHIS

## Description
I have made a README generator for those looking to up their game and get a professional look on their READMEs.

### Motivation
Well I do a lot of HW that always requires a README. So now I can easily have one generated!

### Problem Solved
Spending a lot of time presenting your project that you've already worked so hard on.

### What I Learned
How a professional README looks & JQUERY functionality

## Usage
Whichever folder you may like this generator to be in go ahead and run git clone https://github.com/DuleskyJ/READTHIS.git. cd into there and get to the installation process! Then answer a buttload of questions.
