# READTHIS

## Description
To provide the internet access to a beautiful README generator! All you have to do is clone the repository in a direcotry of your own and follow the next steps.

### Motivation
Every project I've done requires a proper looking readme so the user can easily use whatever I may create!

### Problem Solved
It saves me A LOT of time when it comes to READMEs but also structures it efficiently.

### What I Learned
How to correctly format a README but also dynamically generate one as well.
